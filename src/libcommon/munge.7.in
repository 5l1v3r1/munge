munge \- MUNGE Uid 'N' Gid Emporium

.SH DESCRIPTION
MUNGE (MUNGE Uid 'N' Gid Emporium) is a service for creating and validating
credentials in order to allow a process to securely authenticate the UID and
GID of another local or remote process within a security realm.  Clients can
create and validate these credentials without the use of root privileges,
reserved ports, or platform-specific methods.
.PP
A credential is created and validated by the local \fBmunged\fR daemon
running on each host within a security realm.  A security realm is
defined by the secret key; \fBmunged\fR daemons running on different hosts
are in the same realm if they share the same key.  A client creates or
validates a given credential through the use of the \fBlibmunge\fR library or
\fBmunge\fR/\fBunmunge\fR executables; these are responsible for communicating
with the local daemon on behalf of the client.
.PP
The contents of the credential (including any optional payload data)
are encrypted with a key shared by all \fBmunged\fR daemons within the
security realm.  The integrity of the credential is ensured by a message
authentication code (MAC).  The credential is valid for a limited time defined
by its time-to-live (TTL).  The daemon ensures unexpired credentials are
not being replayed on a particular host.  Decoding of a credential can be
restricted to a particular user and/or group ID.  The payload data can be
used for purposes such as embedding the destination's address to ensure the
credential is valid on only that host.  The internal format of the credential
is encoded in a platform-independent manner.  And the credential itself is
base64 encoded to allow it to be transmitted over virtually any transport.
