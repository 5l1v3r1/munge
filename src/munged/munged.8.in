.SH NAME
munged \- MUNGE daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B munged
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmunged\fR server is responsible for authenticating local clients and
servicing credential encode & decode requests.  All \fBmunged\fR servers
within an administrative realm share a secret key.  This key is used to
protect the contents of a credential.
.PP
When a credential is created, \fBmunged\fR embeds various metadata within it
including the effective UID and GID of the requesting client (as determined by
\fBmunged\fR) and the current time (as determined by the local clock).  Next,
it computes a message authentication code over this data.  Then, it compresses,
encrypts, and base64-encodes the result before returning it to the client.
.PP
When a credential is validated, \fBmunged\fR first checks the message
authentication code to ensure the credential has not been subquently altered.
Next, it checks the embedded UID/GID restrictions to determine whether the
requesting client is allowed to decode it.  Then, it checks the embedded
encode time against the current time; if this difference exceeds the embedded
time-to-live, the credential has expired.  Finally, it checks whether this
credential has been previously decoded on this host; if so, the credential
has been replayed.  The resulting metadata and payload are then returned to
the client.

.SH NOTES
All clocks within an administrative realm must be kept in sync within the
credential time-to-live setting.
.PP
While \fBmunged\fR prevents a given credential from being decoded on a
particular node more than once, nothing prevents it from being decoded on
another node within the administrative realm before it expires.
