.SH NAME
munged \- MUNGE daemon

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B munged
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBmunged\fR daemon is responsible for authenticating local MUNGE clients
and servicing their credential encode & decode requests.  All \fBmunged\fR
daemons within a security realm share a secret key.  This key is used to
protect the contents of a credential.
.PP
When a credential is created, \fBmunged\fR embeds various metadata within it
including the effective UID and GID of the requesting client (as determined by
\fBmunged\fR) and the current time (as determined by the local clock).  Next,
it computes a message authentication code over this data.  Then, it compresses,
encrypts, and base64-encodes the result before returning it to the client.
.PP
When a credential is validated, \fBmunged\fR first checks the message
authentication code to ensure the credential has not been subquently altered.
Next, it checks the embedded UID/GID restrictions to determine whether the
requesting client is allowed to decode it.  Then, it checks the embedded
encode time against the current time; if this difference exceeds the embedded
time-to-live, the credential has expired.  Finally, it checks whether this
credential has been previously decoded on this host; if so, the credential
has been replayed.  The resulting metadata and payload are then returned to
the client.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-h, --help"
Display a summary of the command-line options.
.TP
.BI "-L, --license"
Display license information.
.TP
.BI "-V, --version"
Display version information.
.TP
.BI "-f, --force"
Force the process to run if at all possible.  This overrides warnings such
as an existing local domain socket or a lack of entropy for the PRNG.
.TP
.BI "-F, --foreground"
Run the process in the foreground.
.TP
.BI "-S, --socket " string
Specify the local domain socket for communicating with clients.
.TP
.BI "--auth-server-dir " directory
Specify an alternate directory in which the daemon will create the pipe used to
authenticate clients.  The recommended permissions for this directory are 0711.
This option is only valid on platforms where client authentication is performed
via a file-descriptor passing mechanism.
This option will be removed once configuration file support is added.
.TP
.BI "--auth-client-dir " directory
Specify an alternate directory in which clients will create the file used to
authenticate themselves to the daemon.  The recommended permissions for this
directory are 1733.  This option is only valid on platforms where client
authentication is performed via a file-descriptor passing mechanism.
This option will be removed once configuration file support is added.
.TP
.BI "--key-file " file
Specify an alternate secret key file.
This option will be removed once configuration file support is added.
.TP
.BI "--num-threads " integer
Specify the number of threads to spawn for processing credential requests.
This option will be removed once configuration file support is added.

.SH NOTES
All clocks within a security realm must be kept in sync within the credential
time-to-live setting.
.PP
While \fBmunged\fR prevents a given credential from being decoded on a
particular host more than once, nothing prevents it from being decoded on
another host within the security realm before it expires.
