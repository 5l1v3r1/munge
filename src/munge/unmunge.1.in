.SH NAME
unmunge \- MUNGE credential decoder

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B unmunge
[\fIOPTION\fR]...

.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fBunmunge\fR program validates a MUNGE credential (e.g., one created by
the \fBmunge\fR program).
.PP
By default, the credential is read from stdin and the metadata & payload
are written to stdout.  When the metadata and payload are written to the
same stream, they are separated by a blank line.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-h, --help"
Display a summary of the command-line options.
.TP
.BI "-L, --license"
Display license information.
.TP
.BI "-V, --version"
Display version information.
.TP
.BI "-i, --input " file
Input the credential from the specified file.
.TP
.BI "-n, --no-output"
Discard all output.
.TP
.BI "-m, --metadata " file
Output metadata to the specified file.
.TP
.BI "-o, --output " file
Output the payload to the specified file.
.TP
.BI "-k, --keys " string
Specify a subset of metadata keys to output.  The keys are case-insensitive
and delimited by whitespace, commas, semicolons, or periods -- as long as the
string is treated as a single argument by the shell (e.g., enclosed by quotes).
If a subset is not specified, all available keys are selected by default.
.TP
.BI "-K, --list-keys"
Display a list of metadata keys.
.TP
.BI "-S, --socket " string
Specify the local domain socket for connecting with \fBmunged\fR.

.SH "METADATA KEYS"
The following metadata keys are supported.
.TP
.B STATUS
The status of the credential decode operation.
.TP
.B ENCODE_HOST
The address of the host on which the credential was encoded.
.TP
.B ENCODE_TIME
The time at which the credential was encoded (according to the clock of the
host that encoded it).
.TP
.B DECODE_TIME
The time at which the credential was decoded (according to the local clock).
.TP
.B TTL
The time-to-live value (in seconds) placed within the credential.
.TP
.B CIPHER
The cipher type used to encode the credential.
.TP
.B MAC
The MAC type used to encode the credential.
.TP
.B ZIP
The compression type used to encode the credential.
.TP
.B UID
The user ID of the process that encoded the credential.
.TP
.B GID
The group ID of the process that encoded the credential.
.TP
.B UID_RESTRICTION
The user ID restriction placed within the credential.
.TP
.B GID_RESTRICTION
The group ID restriction placed within the credential.
.TP
.B LENGTH
The length (in bytes) of the payload.

.SH "EXIT STATUS"
The \fBunmunge\fR program returns an exit code corresponding to the return
code of \fBmunge_decode\fR(3).  On success, it returns a zero exit code which
signifies the credential is valid.  On error, it prints an error message to
stderr and returns a non-zero exit code.
