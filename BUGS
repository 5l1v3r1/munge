- munged can occasionally drop a client request when it gets inundated
- munged replay state is not saved across sessions, thereby allowing
  unexpired creds to be replayed after the daemon has been restarted
- munged configuration is hard-coded in libcommon/munge_defs.h & munged/conf.c
- munged run in the foreground does not terminate on sigint under !linux
