- munged needs support for a configuration file; configuration is currently
  set by src/libcommon/munge_defs.h at compile-time
- munged replay state is not saved across sessions, thereby allowing
  unexpired creds to be replayed after the daemon has been restarted
- credentials cannot be restricted based on where they can be decoded
  (eg, hostname/hostrange/regex or ip-addr/netmask)
- munged hangs if client does not respond to auth req (auth via fd passing)
- client hangs if auth-server-dir is permissioned wrong (auth via fd passing)
